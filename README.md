# Our Approach

From the game manual, the scoring is calculated as follows:

● +1 point for each item of litter loaded in the Litterbug or placed on the field at the

any parts that have come off the competition robot.

● +2 points for each item of litter in the correct bin (Cans in the can bin, bottles in
the plastic bin, snack bags and paper trays in the trash bin)

● +1 point for each can or bottle placed in the trash bin. No points are awarded for
putting incorrect items in a particular recycle bin.

● -1 point for each piece of litter from the match that is outside the field perimeter
and not in a bin or touching the robot

● +2 points for each type of litter that the litterbug has been persuaded to no longer
dispense, as indicated by the litterbug lights going out. An additional +2 point
bonus will be awarded if the litterbug has been persuaded to no longer dispense
any of the types of litter, as indicated by all four lights going out.
